# BehaviouralAnalysis-ForestDormouse

This repository contains a **reproducible R workflow** for analyzing **locomotor behavior, posture, and substrate use** in the forest dormouse (*Dryomys nitedula*). 

The project examines how dormice use substrates of different **types, sizes, and inclinations**, and quantifies **habitat preference vs. availability** using Jacobs' Index. Analyses also explore **sex-specific patterns, behavioral context, and comparative relationships**  between body mass and substrate or locomotion use across arboreal species.

### The workflow includes:

* Import and cleaning of raw behavioral observation data
* Validation of data pooling assumptions
* Substrate availability and use analysis
* Habitat preference estimation (Jacobs' Index)
* Behavior x substrate relationships
* Species-level regression analyses

All analyses are fully scripted and reproducible.

Developed as part of a Master's thesis in behavioral ecology, this repository provides a modular framework that can be adapted to other arboreal species or conservation monitoring datasets.

**Note:** Raw data filenames retain original Greek characters. All scripts are encoding-safe and tested on Windows.
